$(CHAPTER ch2, Chapter 2. Types)

$(P
Every thinkable thing, that is every thing we can think about,
falls into some $(I category) in our mind or in other words has a $(I type).
$(I Type) is an abstraction, an idea about a thing.
For example, we have an idea what a table is:
some flat surface with 3+ legs;
in our mind all tables share the same properties,
however each real table is different.
)

$(P
Similar to how humans think in term of types, programming languages
have concept of $(I type) for every object they deal with.
For example, in D, an integral numeric variable has type `int`,
a string of characters has type `string`,
a real number has type `float`.
Implicitly or explicitly but every object in a program
has some type.
