$(H2 Introduction)

$(P
This book targets young students making their first steps in learning Computer Programming.
All explanations are simple and should be understandable for a middle school student.

Therefore, with that in mind about the targeted audience, the following is true about the text:
$(UL
$(LI
No preexisting knowledge in computer programming is required.
All the necessary information for understanding technical terminology and concepts
are introduced in the book.
)
$(LI
No knowledge in math beyond a middle school program is required.
)
$(LI
Easy to read.
Explanations are simple compared to most books with similar titles.
)
$(LI
Focuses on the fundamental aspects of Programming;
the reader is not overloaded with details or
D language specifics.
)
$(LI
No need for a certain computer or Operating System.
No need to install anything.
All examples can be run using online service $(LINK http://dpaste.dzfl.pl).

Why a book for kids?
Kids get exposed to computer technologies at a very early age:
at home and school, using phones, playing computer games,
participating in Internet social networks, doing remote education end so on.
The truth is that modern age kids are working with computer technologies on
a daily basis, nevertheless traditional education systems still
do not fully recognize it and teach
Programming classes later than they could.
This book is trying to
close this gap by giving young students easy to read introductory text on Programming.

$(P
Why this book is different from other "Programming for Kids" books?:
$(UL
$(LI
It does not try to be playful. No silly, cartoonish pictures.
)
$(LI
It does not teach by trying to show tons of examples.
Instead, it
focuses on the most important concepts and tries to explain them
in the simplest way.
)
$(LI
It does not try to convince a reader that programming is easy and fun,
because it would be a misleading message. Instead, it shows that programming
is an act of creation, a form of art that rewards the programmer proportionally
to the effort a person puts into it.
)
)
)

$(P
All code examples are written in a programming language called D.
Reasons why D language was chosen:
$(UL
$(LI Clear syntax.)
$(LI Reflections help to explain what is what in the program.)
$(LI Has support for different styles of programming.)
$(LI All considered it is good for demonstrating many aspects of programming.)
)
)

$(P
In order to run code examples in the book,
nothing is required from a reader other than Web Browser:
online resource $(LINK http://dpaste.dzfl.pl) executes D code and shows
program's output.
)

$(P
To be a programmer and write computer programs
it really helps to understand how computers work.
For that author recommends a book written for kids by Charles Petzold
called "Code. The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software".
)

$(P
One of the biggest challenges with doing introductions into something
as big of a topic as Programming, is that it is almost impossible
to introduce all material in strongly sequential order without
mentioning other not-yet-studyet topics. 
So a reader shall not be too concerned if something does not make
entire sense; make a note of it and move on, return to it later
when more things about programming are understood.
