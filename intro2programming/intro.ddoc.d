$(H2 Introduction)

$(P
This book targets young students making their first steps in learning Computer Programming.
All explanations are simple and should be understandable for a middle school student.

Therefore, with that in mind about the targeted audience, the following is true about the text:
$(UL
$(LI
No preexisting knowledge in computer programming is required.
All necessary for understanding technical terminology and concepts
are introduced in the book.
)
$(LI
No knowledge in math beyond middle school program is required.
)
$(LI
Easy to read.
Explanations are simple compare to most of the books with similar titles.
)
$(LI
Focus is on the fundamental aspects of Programming;
reader is not overloaded with details or
D language specifics.
)
$(LI
No need for certain computer or Operating System.
No need to install anything.
All examples can run using online service $(LINK http://dpaste.dzfl.pl).

Why book for kids?
Kids get exposed to computer technologies at a very early age:
at home and school, using phones, playing computer games,
participating in Internet social networks, doing remote education end so on.
The truth is that modern age kids are working with Information Technologies on
every day basis, nevertheless traditional education systems still
do not fully recognize it and teach
Programming classes later than they could.
So this book is trying to
close this gap by giving young students easy to read introductory text on Programming.

$(P
Where this book is different from other "Programming for Kids" books:
$(UL
$(LI
It does not try to be playful. No silly pictures like
one of a computer box with a face.
)
$(LI
It does not teach by trying to show tons of examples.
Instead, it
focuses on most important concepts and tries to explain them
in the simplest way.
)
$(LI
It does not try to convince a reader that programming is easy and fun,
because it would be a misleading message. Instead, it shows that programming
is an act of creation, a form of art that rewards programmer proportionally
to the effort she puts into it.
)
)
)

$(P
All code examples are written in programming language called D.
Reasons D language was chosen:
$(UL
$(LI Clear syntax.)
$(LI Reflections help to explain what is what in the program.)
$(LI Has support for different styles of programming.)
$(LI All considered is good for demonstrating many aspects of programming.)
)
)

$(P
In order to run code examples in the book,
nothing is required from a reader other than Web Browser:
online resource $(LINK http://dpaste.dzfl.pl) executes D code and shows program output.
