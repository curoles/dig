$(H2 Introduction)

$(P
This book targets young students making their first steps in learning Computer Programming.
All explanations are simple and should be understandable for a middle school student.
Therefore, with that in mind about the target audience, the following is true about the text:
$(UL
$(LI No pre-existing knowledge in computer programming is required.
     All neccessary for understaning technical terminology and concepts
     are introduced in the book.)
$(LI No knowlenge in math beyound middle school is required.)
$(LI Easy to read. Subjects are simplified compare to most of the typical books with similar titles.)
$(LI Focus is on the fundamental aspects of Programming; reader is not overloaded with
     D language specific details.)
$(LI
No need for certain computer or Operating System.
No need to install anything.
All examples can run using online service $(LINK dpaste.dzfl.pl).

Why book for kids?
Kids get exposed to compter technologies at very early age:
at home and school, using phones, playing computer games,
participating in Internet social networks, doing remote education end so on.
The truth is that modern age kids are working with Information Technologies on
every day basis, but nevertheless traditional education systems still
do not fully recognize it and teach
Programming classes later than they could.
So this book is trying to
close this gap by giving young students easy to read introductory text on Programming.

$(P
Where this book is different from other "Programming for Kids" books:
$(UL
$(LI
It does not try to be playful. No silly pictures.
Drawings of a computer box with a face does not achive anything
and is unneccesory distraction.
)
$(LI
It does not teach by trying to show tons of examples.
Instead it
focuses on most important concepts and tries to explain them
in simplest way.
)
$(LI
It does not try to convince a reader that programming is easy and fun,
because it would be a misleading message. Instead it shows that programming
is an act of creation, a form of art that rewards programmer proportionally
to the effort she puts into it.
)
)
)

$(P
All code examples are written in D programming language.
Reasons D language was choosen:
$(UL
$(LI Clear syntax.)
$(LI Reflections help to explain what is what in the program.)
$(LI Has support for different styles of programming.)
$(LI All considered is good for demonstrating many aspects of programming.)
)
)

$(P
In order to run code examples in the book,
nothing is required from a reader other than Web Browser:
online resource $(LINK dpaste.dzfl.pl) executes D code and shows program output.
