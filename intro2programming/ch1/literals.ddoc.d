$(H2 Literals)

$(P
Literals are those numbers and strings that you see in code:
---
int luckyNumber = 777; // 777 is integer literal.

string greetings = "Hello!"; // "Hello" is string literal.

float pi = 3.14; // 3.14 is floating point number literal.
---
)

$(P
As we have already discussed, a computer program is a list of instructions.
How do literals fit into "list of instructions"? Literals are data, not
instructions. But if we think about an instruction as some sort of a command
with parameters, then literals become those parameters.

$(P
Any literal is constant by definition. If you see number `777` in a program text,
then it means nothing more and nothing less than number 777, 777 can't be
any other number by definition. But most of real world programs and algorithms
require more than just constant values, they need data storages called $(I variables)
that might hold any value and change during run time. And that is what will
be our next topic.
