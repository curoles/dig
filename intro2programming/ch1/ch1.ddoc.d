$(H1 Chapter 1. Computer Program)

$(P
A computer program, as any other program in that sense,
is a list of instructions to a computer to execute.
People make all sorts of (non-computer) programs, for example:

$(OL
$(LI
You give to someone a walking direction:
go straight two blocks, then turn left and so on.
You essentially created a program with instructions
to be executed by that person.
)
$(LI
Cooking recipe is a good example
of a program.
)
$(LI
You change your phone's
settings to react in certain way on arriving call or message.
You might actually consider it a computer program. Indeed, now days
phones have powerful computers inside them and by
changing phone's settings you programmed the computer inside.

$(P
Every program has to be a$(RPAREN) formulated in some form and b$(RPAREN) stored
in some storage for later execution.
Let us consider examples:
$(OL
$(LI
You are giving to someone walking directions.
Your voice conveys instructions
in human native language that are stored in other person brain.
)
$(LI
Road signs express their commands in a form of agreed upon traffic control symbols.
A sign along a road is storage by itself.
)
$(LI
Phone settings are set by selecting certain options
in phone's User Interface, selected options stored in phone's
memory and later on are used as instructions for phone
to act in response to some events or conditions.
