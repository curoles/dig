$(H1 Chapter 1. Computer Program)

$(P
A computer program, as any other program in that sense,
is a list of instructions to computer to execute.
In this broad sense, in our normal life activities
we deal with programs and instructions every day.
For example:
$(OL
$(LI You give someone a walking direction:
  go straight two blocks, then turn left and so on.
  You essentially created a program with instructions
  to be executed by that person.
)
$(LI Cooking recipe is a good example
  of detailed program.
)
$(LI You change your phone
  settings to react in certain way on arriving call or message.
  You might consider it computer program. Indeed, now days
  phones have powerful computers inside them and by
  changing phone's settings you program the computer inside.
)
)
)

$(P
Every program has to be a$(RPAREN) formulated in some form and b$(RPAREN) stored
in some storage for later execution.
Let us consider examples:
$(OL
$(LI You command someone what to do, say you give walking directions.
  Your voice conveyes instructions
  in human native language that are stored in other person brain.
)
$(LI Road signs express their commands in form of agreed upon traffic control symbols.
  A sign along a road is storage by itself.
)
$(LI Phone settings are formulated by selecting certain options
  in phone User Interface, selected options stored in phones
  memory and later on are used as instructions for phone
  to act in response to some event or conditions.
