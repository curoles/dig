$(H2 Keywords)

5things + insticts

$(P
Except for one thing, we have learned so far about
most of the stuff you will see in a program:
$(UL
$(LI literals)
$(LI variables and their types)
$(LI functions and operators)
)

The last thing in language syntax we are going to cover
in this chapter is called $(I keywords).
$(I keywords) is a group of special words recognized by the computer language.
They form language vocabulary that programmer is using
to do the basic things, but they are the very foundation of the language.
This vocabulary is small, couple dozens words,
so it is easy for a human to remember them and what they do.
Keywords give the basic functionality to the language
and could be divided by their purpose in following groups:
$(UL
$(LI
Pre-defined or built-in data types like: `int`, `float` and `string`.
)
$(LI
Keywords `if` and `else` responsible for $(I Thing #2: Choose between two options).
)
$(LI
Keywords `for` and `foreach` do $(I Thing #3: Looping and repeating).
)
$(LI
Keywords `struct` and `class` help to define new data types.
)
$(LI
Keyword `import` allows to use code defined in other file or module.
)
)
)

$(P
There are other keywords, but we will learn them later, once we need
them.
