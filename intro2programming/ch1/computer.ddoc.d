$(H2 Computer)

$(P
People make computers to do things that are too boring or tedous
for people to do. List of things people can do in their mind:
$(OL
$(LI
Count numbers (really we are only good for countng our fingers,
it gets harder after 10 for us)
)
$(LI
Choose between two options based on some condition.
)
$(LI
Repeat something several times.
)
$(LI
Memorize things and be able to find it in the memory
by their name. It includes categorisation.
)
$(LI
Interact with external world. Use senses to get and collect information.
Use voice or gestures to communicate with others.
)
)
)


$(P
Not very long list if you think about it. Pretty much everything
we concesly do is combination of these 5 operations.
We also have
insincts that are embedded into us by design and evolution.
)

$(P
It should not surprize you then that computers only can
do the same 5 things:
$(OL
$(LI Count numbers.)
$(LI Choose between two options and branch execution accodingly.)
$(LI Stay in a loop and repeat.)
$(LI Store data in memory wuth a tag. Find in memory by the tag.)
$(LI Get user input from keyboard. Print results out.)
)
)

Therefore, when programmer writes computer program it can command
computer to do just these 5 things, but he has freedom to combine
them at his will.
