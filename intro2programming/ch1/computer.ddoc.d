$(H2 Computer)

$(P
People make computers to do things that are too boring or tedious
for people to do. List of things people can do in or with their mind:
$(OL
$(LI
Memorize things and be able to find them in the memory
by their name. It includes categorization and abstracting things.
)
$(LI
Count numbers (really we are only good for counting our fingers,
it gets harder after 10 for us).
)
$(LI
Choose between two options based on some condition.
)
$(LI
Repeat something several times.
)
$(LI
Interact with external world. Use senses to get and collect information.
Use voice or gestures to communicate with others.
)
)
)


$(P
Not very long list if you think about it.
Pretty much everything we consciously do is combination of these 5 operations.
We also have instincts that are embedded into us
by design and evolution, they drive our desires and provide basic functions.
)

$(P
Since people make computers and write programs,
it should not surprise you then that computers also can only
do the same 5 things:
$(OL
$(LI Store data in a memory with a tag. Find in the memory by the tag.)
$(LI Count numbers.)
$(LI Choose between options and branch execution accordingly.)
$(LI Stay in a loop and repeat something.)
$(LI Get user input from a keyboard. Print results out.)
)
)

$(P
Therefore, when programmer writes computer program
each line of the code commands
computer to do just one of those $(I 5 Things),
but programmer has freedom to mix
them together at his will.
Therefore, no matter how complex a program might look like,
it essentially is just
a lot of individually simple commands mixed together.
)

$(P
There is one more thing to discuss in regard to "what computer does".
As it was said before, your program could be $(I compiled) by a $(I compiler) into machine
code that computer executes directly or $(I interpreted) by a program
called $(I interpreter).
We can run our D programs in both ways, but in this book we are
going to use $(I compiler) and even check how our code was translated
to native machine code.
