$(H2 Scope)

$(P
When you read English text and see definite article $(B the)
in front of a noun, you can figure out that specific or particular
thing the text is talking about. Definite article $(B the) implies
some context or scope for you to use for figuring out specifics.
For example, "the boy" in one paragraph and "the boy" in another
paragraph may point to different boys, but a reader should be
able to figure out which particular boy it is.

$(P
Most programming languages, inluding D, define $(I scope) or $(I visibility domain)
for variables, functions and etc. It would be very hard to have
single global visibility domain, you would not be able to reuse any name,
in other words you would have to memorize all names and do use any
name twice.
