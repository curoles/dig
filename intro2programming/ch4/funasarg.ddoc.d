$(H2 Using a Function as Argument)

$(P
So far we have seen that a function can have an argument that is
a data. But nothing should stop us from using one function
as an argument of another. Indeed, a function is a collection
of instructions, an array of instructions if you will, therefore
we should be able to send a pointer to such container to any function.
The reason we might want to do a trick like that is because
it will help us to create very modular and flexible
algorithm where functions are parameterized by other functions.
