$(CHAPTER ch8, Chapter 8. Algorithms)

$(P
The word $(I algorithm) came from mathematics.
An $(I algorithm) is a set of steps or a procedure or formula for solving a problem.
It is no coicedence that it sounds a lot like the definition of a $(I program),
they are synonims. Still in computer science engineers like to think about
an algorithm as some high level function like math function.
An algorithm does not specify how to implement it with any specific computer language,
but rather gives you
a formula or a recipe of what has to be done.
)

$(P
There are many types of problems and corresponding algorithms.
If you think about it, it is not possible for a programmer
(unless she is Hollywood movie character) to
have knowledge in all knowledge domains like math, physics, construction and etc.
In order to have the work done usually a programmer:
$(UL
$(LI
first searches for available algorithms that were developed by experts
with the domain knowledge;
)
$(LI
then tries to find program libraries that implement required algorithm;
)
$(LI
if the algorithm was not implemented yet or an implementation is not available
or is not right for some reasons, only then programmer implements it.
)
)

)

$(P
In following sections of this chapter we will be developing algorithms
and then implementing them.
